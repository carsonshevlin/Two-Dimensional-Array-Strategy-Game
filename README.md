# Two-Dimensional-Array-Strategy-Game
User creates board with given row and column limits. Program will place a winning value (1) at a random location, then runs through array placing increasing values at near neighbors (top, right, left bottom). The higher the value, the farther from the winning location; the lower the value, the closer to the winning location.
